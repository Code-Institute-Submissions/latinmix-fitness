![LatinMix Fitness Mockup](# "LatinMix Fitness Mockup") *// Image to be included once site completed*

An intuitive website for LatinMix Fitness, a new dance academy focused on Latin rhythms with a fitness twist.
The website showcases the offered classes and its respective timetable, membership options, contact and directions information.
The main goal of the website is to attract new customers.

Business goals includes:
- Increase the number of registered clients.
- Establish brand awareness.
- Showcase offered services effectively.
- Display contact and directions information.

Customers goals includes:
- Find fun and compelling exercise classes information.
- Clear access to membership plans and how to pay instructions.
- Easily find contact information and directions of dance academy.

## UX
### User stories
1.	As a new visitor to the website, I want to easily navigate throughout all pages of the website.
2.	As a new visitor to the website, I want to clearly identify what classes that are being offered.
3.	As a potential client, I want to learn more about each individual class.
4.	As a potential client, I want to easily find the directions to the facility as the business contact information.
5.	As a potential client, I want to find clear pricing and payment instructions.
6.	As an existing client, I want to be on top of all updates on classes and offers.

### Strategy 
The website must display the product offered clearly and have all contact information and direction presented to the user.
As Latin rhythms can look challenging for new learners, it is interesting to detail each class and showcase a small video in a fun and inviting way.
It is also of interest to display a gallery and the business history; however, the content is not currently available as LatinMix Fitness is a new facility.

### Scope
It was deemed of most importance to present the classes and contact / directions to the potential client.
Clear pricing is an important aspect of B2C design and easy to implement, so it should be included on the first website release.
About page and Gallery page are not feasible for the current website release, as resource is not available. 

### Structure
The website is design so the user can get all the required information to book a class from the main Home page.
The information is structured to answer the following questions in descending order “What is this business?”, “What are the classes offered and time?”, “How much it costs?”.
Also, from the Home page the user can access further information on each section.
The structure for every remaining page will be user friendly and expand on the Home page information on small units of details.

### Skeleton

#### Deviations from planed wireframes
- Footer information for mobile screens was stacked instead of shown inline as the content would not fit.

### Surface
#### Colour
The website will use vibrant colour palette to evoke fun and exciting feelings.
The colour palette used is extracted from the hero image and have tones of green (eggshell) and vibrant pinks.

#### Typography
Headings will follow the logo font-family “Abhaya Libre” with slight increased letter spacing for better readability.
All other text will be set to font-family “Open Sans”.
Default fall-back font-family: "sans-Serif".
